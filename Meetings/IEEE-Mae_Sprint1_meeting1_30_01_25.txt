Present participants:

Malcolm - OOP
Yara - Python web dev
Alex - CSS, React, React Native
Abu - CSS, databases
Camila - HTML, CSS, React, React Native

How do we want to build it?

Development Technologies: React and Firebase
IDE: Webstorm (for unified development) - everyone needs to learn to use it
Hosting: IEEE lab or Cami's hosting site or directly through github or web server (if needed)

Fourth feature: stickers, etc. 

Step 1: Create User Stories (US) for entire project for backlog
Step 2: Select which US for Sprint 1  - set up the Burndown Chart
Step 3: Decompose Sprint 1 US into tasks and assign them - set up Sprint Plan within Burndown Chart

We created the general US for the entire project in the Burndown Chart

Post-meeting actionables:
- assign team roles (scrum master, etc.)
- ask if roles must be assigned upon login or if they can be assigned after channel creation (teams or discord)
- select which US to tackle in Sprint 1
- subdivide Sprint 1 US into tasks & assign responsibles
- complete tasks (code!)
