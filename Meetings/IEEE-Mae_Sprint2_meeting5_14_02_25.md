How are we expected to implement the CI in github with actions? TBA

- Write 2 acceptance tests (in Github as issues) for the user stories identified in the first sprint. AT.## and link them to a user story->task.
- These AT should just be like "when user clicks this, this happens..." specifying requirements and what is expected to happen.
- Follow criteria to create user story (requirements and acceptance needs)

## Post meeting actionables
- TA will check what is expected of us for the CI pipeline on github? Are we supposed to test on push, what does this look like?
