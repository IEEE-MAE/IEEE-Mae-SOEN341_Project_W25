- demoed functionality in lab
- tests work well in CI
- plan next sprint
- fourth features: edit messages, delete messages in DMs with a time threshold. Explain hierarchy to prof for teams implementation.
- write a single test case per component (instead of multiple per component) - reduce load but expand reach. set threshold lower so that test coverage is larger. so the build passes with higher percentage.
