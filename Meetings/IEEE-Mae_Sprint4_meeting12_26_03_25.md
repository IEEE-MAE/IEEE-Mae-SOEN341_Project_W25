### Meeting Notes
- went over requirements for the sprint, assigned tasks and responsibilities

- need to do replies/quoting (just a display thing of replying - a single message - no thread making/backend) - MAC
- fourth feature: delete and edit messages with limit of time
  - backend develops function to set boolean hook depending on conditions - delete and edit buttons - CAMI & ALEX (deadline 30 Mar)
  - frontend uses boolean hook to variably display buttons for deleting and editing  - MAC
- ask this friday about the static analysis requirements - what is expected as a deliverable from it at the end of the sprint
- responsibles for setting up static testing and code review - ABU, YARA & MAE
- once testing is set up, CAMI & ALEX will fix bugs identified by it

### Post-Meeting Actionables 
- Pick an automatic testing tool (SonarQube) and ask for approval
- Plan how to make the final presentation
- Once we are finished with all of the implementation and bug fixes, work on cleaning up the code (removing pages that are not used e.g. channels, etc) and re-structuring it so it satisfies the guidelines set in Appendix A of the Sprint 4 Guidelines document.
