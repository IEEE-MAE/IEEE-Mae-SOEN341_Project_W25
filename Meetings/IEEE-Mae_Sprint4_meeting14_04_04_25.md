- we NEED TO DO **ACCEPTANCE TESTS** FOR EVERY SINGLE USER STORY (linked) for Sprint 4 - ABU
- **Code review:** The code review process is highly effective, with thorough evaluations, constructive feedback, and a focus on improving code quality.
- **Coding standards:**	Coding standards are clearly defined and effectively communicated to the team through the Wiki.
- **Code Maintainance:** guided by static analysis tool	"The team fixed 5 bugs reported by an automatic tool.  The bugs selected were the top 5 critical ones and the codebase shows significant improvement in terms of reliability and maintainability.
A comprehensive range of bugs is identified and resolved, demonstrating a deep understanding of the codebase.
The team documented their maintenance effort with code commits with a detailed description, including references to the linter reports that triggered the fixes"
- **Repository organization:** Comply with all the guidelines defined in Appendix A of the instructions.  The organization of files is exemplary, demonstrating a high level of understanding and adherence to best practices.
