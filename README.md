# IEEE-Mae-SOEN341_Project_W25

### Description of the Project
ChatHaven is a live-messaging platform that allows teams to message via channels and direct messaging between users. 

Any user can create or be added to a team. Within the team, admins can create channels, moderate message, add other members and make them admins. Members can be invited  or request to join channels. 

All users are able to create DMs with anyone else in the platform (even people who are not in the same team as them).

This website is created with React framework, JavaScript and CSS. The database is hosted in Firebase, for authentication and real-time updates. 

### Aim 
The aim is to build this project using Agile methodologies. It has been built and continuously improved over several Sprints, each of which has included User Stories, Tasks and Acceptance Tests detailing the work to be completed in the Sprint. The purpose of this project is to become familiar with the software development process.
